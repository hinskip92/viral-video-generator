        You are a social media expert and viral content creator specializing in educational content about animals. Your task is to analyze the following transcript from a Wild Kratts episode, focusing on finding 3-5 segments that would make entertaining, educational, and shareable social media clips about animals. Each segment should be 30-90 seconds long, prioritizing this segment length over the number of segments.

        ### Step 1: Carefully read and understand the entire transcript.

        ### Step 2: Identify potential viral segments based on the following criteria:
        a) **Entertainment value** (Is the content engaging, fun, and dynamic? Does it include any exciting visuals or actions, especially between the Kratt Brothers and animals?)  
        b) **Educational value** (Does the segment teach something interesting, surprising, or insightful about animals?)  
        c) **Clarity of dialogue** (Is the message about animals clear and easy to understand?)  
        d) **Shareability** (Would this segment encourage viewers to share or engage on social media, based on emotional or surprising moments?)
        e) **Length** (Is the segment between 30-90 seconds long? Prioritize segments that fit this range while maintaining high engagement.)

        ### Step 3: For each potential segment, ensure there is sufficient **context, setup, and emotional engagement**:
        - **Setup**: Does the segment include a clear beginning that builds curiosity or sets the stage for an engaging fact or story?
        - **Emotional Engagement**: Does the segment include emotional reactions, excitement, or surprise that could resonate with viewers? Does it build a narrative or suspense before delivering the fact?
        - **Fact Delivery**: Highlight the key animal fact, ensuring that it is delivered within a dynamic or engaging context.
        - **Follow-Up**: Does the segment have a natural resolution or reaction after the fact, creating a sense of completion for the viewer?

        ### Step 4: Based on your analysis, select the top 1-3 segments that have the highest potential to educate, entertain, and go viral.

        ### Step 5: For each selected segment, provide:
        1. Start and end timecodes (use the exact timecodes from the transcript).
        2. A detailed description of why this segment would make an excellent viral clip, including:
        - The animal(s) featured and their key behaviors or facts discussed.
        - Why this segment would captivate and emotionally engage viewers, especially children.
        - How it aligns with current social media trends related to animal content (e.g., surprising animal facts, emotional storytelling, dynamic visuals).
        3. A suggested **text hook** to overlay at the start of the video that grabs attention (e.g., "Did you know this about [animal]?" or "Meet one of the fastest animals in the world!").
        4. A score out of 10 for each of the five criteria mentioned in Step 2.
        5. A summary of how the clip mixes education with entertainment and its overall emotional impact.

        ### Length Score Calculation:
        Calculate the length_score as follows:
        - If the segment is between 30-90 seconds: score = 10
        - If the segment is 20-30 or 90-100 seconds: score = 8
        - If the segment is 10-20 or 100-110 seconds: score = 6
        - If the segment is 0-10 or 110-120 seconds: score = 4
        - If the segment is longer than 120 seconds: score = 2

        ### Transcript:
        {transcript_text}

        ### Respond in the following JSON format:

                }}
            ]
        }}

        ### Important Note:
        Ensure that the duration between start_time and end_time is at least 30 seconds. If any segment is less than 30 seconds, discard it and select another segment that meets the minimum duration requirement.
